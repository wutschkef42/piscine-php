<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Color class handles transformations such as scaling, translation and rotation to one or several vertices.

In 3D, a 4x4 matrix can be viewed as the representation of an ortho-standardised mark, namely 3 vectors for the 3 axes and one vertex to the origin of the mark. So weâ€™ll represent all our matrices whatever their usefulness in the following manner, namely a basic array.


The class provides the following methods :

Matrix   mult( Matrix $m );
Returns the multiplication of two matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx );
Returns a new vertex resulting from the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
